# Executive Summary

This comprehensive analysis of hospital financial data reveals significant disparities in healthcare pricing, regulatory efficiency, and regional healthcare delivery patterns. The findings demonstrate a fundamental disconnect between hospital billing practices and actual Medicare reimbursements, with critical implications for healthcare policy, cost containment, and system efficiency.

## Key Findings:

•	Pricing Inefficiency: Hospitals charge an average of $3.72 for every $1.00 Medicare pays, creating a $27,640 average gap per discharge

•	Total Financial Impact: Across 7+ million discharges analyzed, the aggregate pricing variance exceeds $193 billion

•	Geographic Disparities: State-level analysis reveals Alaska's average payments are 50% higher than the national average, while Maryland's regulatory model achieves 86% payment-to-charge efficiency

•	Procedure-Specific Concerns: High-intensity respiratory cases show price variances exceeding $118,000 per case

## Financial Baseline

## Overall Market Metrics

Hospitals set an average "sticker price" of $36,130 per discharge through total charges. Medicare actually reimburses an average of $8,490 per case. This creates an average price variance—or gap between billing and payment—of $27,640 per discharge. Nationally, the markup ratio stands at 3.72x, meaning charges average 3.72 times the payments received. These metrics draw from analysis of 7,065,306 total discharges.

## Financial Implications

The 3.72x national markup ratio indicates substantial systemic inefficiency. While Medicare's standardized payment rates provide consistency, the inflated charge master prices create:

•	Transparency Challenges: Patients and commercial payers face opaque pricing with limited correlation to actual costs

•	Cost-Shifting Risk: The $27.6K average variance suggests hospitals may be inflating charges to offset lower government reimbursements

•	Administrative Burden: Processing claims with 372% markups requires extensive reconciliation and adjustment

## Volume Analysis: Clinical Patterns

## High-Volume Procedures

## Major Joint Replacement (DRG 470) dominates inpatient volume with 427,207 discharges, representing 6.1% of all cases analyzed. This reflects:

•	Aging population demographics driving orthopedic demand

•	Elective procedure concentration in high-volume centers

•	Standardization of hip and knee replacement protocols

## Septicemia Cases (DRG 871) rank as the second most common diagnosis, indicating:

•	Growing burden of infectious disease complications

•	Increased prevalence of antibiotic-resistant infections

•	Higher acuity in Medicare-age patient populations

## Provider Volume Leaders

Florida Hospital tops the list as the leading provider with 25,828 total discharges, located in Orlando, FL. New York-Presbyterian ranks second with 16,834 discharges in New York, NY. At the regional level, Florida dominates as a state leader with over 536,000 total discharges.

## Florida's Dominance: The state's concentration of Medicare beneficiaries (retirement demographics) and large hospital systems creates the nation's highest discharge volume at 536,000+ cases.

## Price Variance Analysis: Critical Findings

## Highest Financial Gaps by Diagnosis

The most concerning pricing disparities occur in high-intensity critical care scenarios:

DRG 870, covering Septicemia with Ventilator support for 96+ hours, shows the highest average charge-payment gap at $118,967.84, with a markup ratio of 5.2x. DRG 207, for Respiratory System Diagnosis with Ventilator 96+ hours, follows closely with a $104,839.13 gap and 4.9x markup. DRG 249, involving Percutaneous Cardiovascular Procedures, exhibits a variable gap but a consistent 4.68x markup ratio.

## Analysis of High-Variance Cases

## Critical Care Markup Concerns:

Septicemia cases requiring extended ventilator support demonstrate the largest financial gap at nearly $119,000 per case. This variance raises several concerns:

•	ICU Cost Structure: Extended ventilator cases involve genuine high costs (staffing, equipment, pharmaceuticals), but the 5.2x markup suggests charge master rates far exceed actual resource consumption

•	Commercial Payer Impact: While Medicare pays standardized rates, commercial insurers negotiating off charge master prices may pay 2-3x more for identical care

•	Outcomes Correlation: High-variance DRGs often involve the sickest patients with poorest outcomes, creating ethical concerns about profit incentives in end-of-life care

## Cardiovascular Procedure Patterns:

Percutaneous cardiovascular procedures (stent placements, catheterizations) consistently show 4.6-4.8x markups, indicating:

•	High-margin procedural focus in hospital strategic planning

•	Significant variation in device costs versus billing practices

•	Potential overutilization in fee-for-service environments

## Geographic and Regulatory Analysis

## State-Level Performance Comparison

Maryland (MD) records an average total payment of $9,340, with Medicare coverage at 85.81% and a low markup ratio of 1.06x under its All-Payer Rate Setting model. Alaska (AK) leads with $14,572 average payments, 68.4% Medicare coverage, and 2.1x markup via Geographic Adjustment. New York (NY) averages $8,920 payments, just 33.79% Medicare coverage, and 2.67x markup in a Market-Based system. Nationally, averages stand at $9,707 payments, 55.2% coverage, and 3.72x markup across Mixed models.

## Maryland Model Success

Maryland's All-Payer hospital rate regulation demonstrates remarkable efficiency:

•	Near-Parity Pricing: 1.06x markup ratio versus 3.72x national average represents 71% reduction in pricing variance

•	Medicare Coverage: 86% payment-to-charge ratio indicates minimal cost-shifting to other payers

•	Policy Implication: Regulated rate-setting eliminates charge master inflation while maintaining hospital financial viability

## Alaska Geographic Premium

Alaska's 50% higher average payments ($14,572 vs. $9,707 national average) reflect legitimate geographic cost differentials:

•	Remote location increases supply chain costs

•	Limited provider competition

•	Higher labor costs in frontier healthcare markets

•	Medicare's geographic payment adjusters functioning as designed

## New York Efficiency Concerns

New York's 33.79% Medicare coverage rate (lowest among major states) combined with 2.67x markup indicates:

•	Heavy reliance on commercial insurance and private pay

•	Potential cost-shifting from government to commercial payers

•	Need for regulatory intervention similar to Maryland model

## Provider-Level Outliers

## Extreme Pricing Variance Institutions

Stanford Hospital reports average charges of $145,410 against $38,640 payments, yielding a $106,770 price variance, focused on Complex Respiratory cases with 96+ hour ventilation. UVA Health Sciences averages $50,360 charges and $9,340 payments for a $41,020 variance in General Acute Care. Vail Valley Medical sees $47,370 charges versus $5,910 payments, resulting in a $41,460 variance centered on Orthopedic and Trauma DRGs.

## Stanford Hospital Case Study

Stanford's extraordinary pricing variance of $106,770 for high-intensity respiratory cases warrants detailed examination:

## Possible Explanations:

•	Academic Medical Center Premium: Teaching hospitals treating complex cases may have legitimately higher costs

•	Charge Master Inflation: California's lack of rate regulation permits aggressive charge master pricing

•	Payer Mix Strategy: High charges create negotiating leverage with commercial insurers

•	Geographic Market Power: Limited competition in service area enables pricing power

## Concern Areas:

•	3.76x markup on already-expensive critical care creates affordability barriers for uninsured/underinsured patients

•	Potential "sticker shock" deterring patients from seeking necessary care

•	Commercial insurers paying 200-300% of Medicare rates for identical services

## Strategic Recommendations

## For Healthcare Policymakers

## 1. Expand All-Payer Rate Regulation

Maryland's success demonstrates regulated pricing reduces variance without compromising access or quality. Consider:

•	Federal waivers for additional states to pilot All-Payer models

•	Mandatory charge master transparency with caps at 150% of Medicare rates

•	Annual review of geographic payment adjusters to ensure accuracy

## 2. Price Transparency Enforcement

The 3.72x national markup underscores need for aggressive implementation of hospital price transparency rules:

•	Enforce penalties for non-compliant hospitals

•	Require disclosure of both charges AND typical payments by payer

•	Create consumer-friendly interfaces showing out-of-pocket estimates

## 3. High-Variance DRG Investigation

DRGs with $100K+ price variances (870, 207) require immediate review:

•	Analyze whether charges reflect actual resource consumption

•	Investigate correlation between high markups and patient outcomes

•	Consider separate payment models for extended ICU stays

## For Hospital Administrators

## 1. Charge Master Rationalization

Hospitals maintaining 3.5-5x markups face reputational and regulatory risk:

•	Conduct charge master audits to align prices with cost structures

•	Adopt cost-to-charge ratios under 2.0x for competitive positioning

•	Prepare for inevitable regulatory pressure toward price controls

## 2. Volume Strategy Reassessment

High-volume, high-margin procedures (joint replacements, cardiovascular) drive financial performance but face sustainability risks:

•	Diversify revenue beyond fee-for-service dependence

•	Invest in value-based care capabilities

•	Develop bundled payment expertise for major procedures

## 3. Geographic Market Analysis

Providers in high-variance states (NY, CA) should anticipate regulatory intervention:

•	Model financial impact of Maryland-style rate regulation

•	Develop contingency plans for markup compression

•	Build relationships with commercial payers to maintain revenue

## For Commercial Payers

## 1. Reference-Based Pricing

The Medicare payment data provides clear benchmarks for contract negotiations:

•	Adopt Medicare + X% pricing models (target 150% or less)

•	Refuse to negotiate from inflated charge master rates

•	Require hospitals to justify prices exceeding Medicare by more than 50%

## 2. Center of Excellence Programs

Volume data enables identification of high-quality, efficient providers:

•	Steer orthopedic cases to high-volume, lower-variance facilities

•	Create narrow networks excluding extreme pricing outliers

•	Reward Maryland-model hospitals with preferred status

# Conclusion

This analysis reveals a healthcare pricing system characterized by substantial inefficiency, geographic inequity, and regulatory inconsistency. The $27,640 average price variance per discharge—multiplied across 7 million cases—represents nearly $200 billion in phantom charges that create administrative burden, reduce transparency, and shift costs to commercial payers and patients.
Maryland's All-Payer model demonstrates that regulated pricing can achieve near-parity between charges and payments (1.06x vs. 3.72x nationally) while maintaining robust hospital financial performance. Expanding this approach while addressing legitimate geographic cost variations (Alaska) and investigating extreme outliers (Stanford, complex respiratory cases) should be immediate policy priorities.
The concentration of volume in elective orthopedics (427,000 joint replacements) versus high-variance critical care (sepsis, extended ventilation) suggests hospitals maintain inflated charge masters primarily to maximize negotiating leverage with commercial payers rather than to reflect actual care costs. This cost-shifting mechanism ultimately increases premiums and out-of-pocket expenses for all Americans.
